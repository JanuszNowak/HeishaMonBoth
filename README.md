# HeishaMonBoth
This is a HeishaMon modification allowing parallel work of Panasonic Web, local reading via MQTT and integration with HomeAssistant.

Special thanks to :
Igor Ybema https://github.com/Egyras/HeishaMon 
and 
Alexander Gregor-Samosir https://github.com/gregor-samosir/HeishaMonKaskade
for their projects that inspired me to write this modification.

The current version of the software does not support Dallas sensors or S0 counter, but the PCB is designed with the ability to extend the interface with these functionalities.

Integration with HomeAssistant identical to the original HeishaMon interface. https://github.com/Egyras/HeishaMon/tree/master/Integrations/Home%20Assistant

Good Luck
